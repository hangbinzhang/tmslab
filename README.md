Website for the [Brain Imaging and TMS Laboratory](https://brain-imaging-and-tms-laboratory.github.io/tmslab/), led by Dr. Ying-hui Chou at the University of Arizona.

Built with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) on a customized [al-folio](https://github.com/alshedivat/al-folio) academic theme.

## Local development

```bash
docker compose up
```

Site runs at http://localhost:8080 with live reload.

## Deployment
